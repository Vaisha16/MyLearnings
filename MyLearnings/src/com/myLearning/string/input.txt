A summary is a short retelling of a longer written passage, containing the authorâ€™s most important ideas. 
Summarizing helps improve both your reading and writing skills. To summarize, you must read a passage closely, finding the main ideas and supporting ideas. 
Then you must briefly write down those ideas in a few sentences or a paragraph.
It is important to understand the difference between a summary and a paraphrase. 
A paraphrase is simply a rewriting of a passage in your own words. 
A summary, on the other hand, contains only the main idea and the supporting ideas of a passage. 
A summary will be much shorter than a paraphrase.
